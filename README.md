# Turing-Simulator

A Turing Machine Simulator created for the Heriot-Watt Programming Challenge.

This program allows full simulation of a Turing machine on an infinite (subject to system limits) tape in one or two dimensions. Programs can be edited via a GUI interface, or imported from a file written in any standard text editor. Programs can be stepped through or automatically executed at varying speed.

If you would like to use, modify or redistribute this software for educational purposes please feel free to do so. If you have any questions, please contact the authors of this repository.

## Installation

The program is available, fully built, in the `Heriot_Sumbission` folder in the state it was submitted for the Heriot-Watt Turing Centenary Programming Challenge. Simply run the .jar file provided by double-clicking or using the terminal command:

    $ java -jar turingsimulator.jar

Some minor changes have been made since then to make the program more readable (`Main` is now actually the Main class). To build the latest version, use the makefile provided.

## Use

A full user manual is provided in the `Heriot Submission` folder.
